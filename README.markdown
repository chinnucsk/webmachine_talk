## WebMachine: Building RESTful APIs with Erlang

These are my slides for a talk I gave on WebMachine to the Sydney Erlang user group.

The slides were produced using [deck.js](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js).

To view the slides open up slides/index.html.

## Errata

Some of the slides contain code that doesn't compile, the intent was to show how you might structure your erlang code in webmachine. If time permits I'll include a working webmachine example.
